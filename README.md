# Logbooker

This app is meant for voyages.
It should gather the GPS position, the weather in the area which you are in
and maybe something else, (i dont know yet), in certain intervalls.

You can create your own voyage and the app will show the days on which you were on that trip.
If you click on the days, the data which were gathered should show up.

On a map you can see your daily and overall route.

##NOTICE: On this point the app is not ready at all :D
